# IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring-System
A Pulse oximeter is a light-based device that is used to measure the arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) as a percentage of hemoglobin in blood and heart rate. Accordingly, the PPG signal is used to monitor the Heart rate by detecting the differences in the blood volume in the investigated area. The variation of heart rate varies on the state of the patient. The average heart rate of an individual at rest should be between 60 to 100 bpm. One the other hand the SpO2 level depends on the concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells, its average value for a healthy individual should be between 95°Contactless Infrared Digital Temperature Sensor can be used to measure temperature of a particular object and the surrounding temperature within range - 70°C to 382.2°C. The sensor uses IR rays to measure the temperature of the object without any physical contact and communicates to the microcontroller (i.e. ESP32 in our case) using the I2C protocol.
